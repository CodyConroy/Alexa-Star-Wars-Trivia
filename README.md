# Alexa-Star-Wars-Trivia
This Alexa Skill aims to test the user's knowledge on Star Wars. To play, the user must first say "Alexa, open star wars trivia 
and test me on Star Wars" to which Alexa will open up with a question. After she asks you the question, if the user does not know the 
answer immediately, the user may ask Alexa to list options. Alexa will then list 4 options and the user must choose one of the options.
If the user does not choose one of the options, Alexa will tell them they were incorrect and also did not choose from the list of 
options. Once the question has been answered, the user may say "ask me another question." This, quite literally, will prompt Alexa to
give the user another question. If the user wishes to exit the Star Wars Trivia Game, the user must simply tell Alexa "stop" or "goodbye."
